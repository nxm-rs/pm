# RLN Relay FURPS

## Functionality

1. Light push service node can attach RLN proof for clients.
2. Relay node can attach RLN proof for outbound messages.
3. Relay node can verify RLN proof for inbound messages.
4. Light push client can be configured to generate proof for outbound messages.
5. Filter client can be configured to verify proof for inbound messages.

## Usability

1. Light push clients do not need RLN logic when using RLNaaS.

## Reliability

1. Relay node can fallback to alternative RPC endpoints
   if the primary Web3 RPC provider becomes unavailable.

## Performance

1. In a network of 10k RLN Relay nodes with each node sending one 1-100KB message every 10-30s,
   messages are propagated within 500ms, with 99.9% success **(Vac-DST)**.
2. In a network of 10k RLN Relay nodes,
   a spamming node will be disconnected from its peers in under 1 min. **(Vac-DST)**

## Supportability

1. Service node proof generation for light push clients is available in `wakunode2` for browser clients.
2. Browser edge nodes can be configured to verify and generate proofs.

## + (Privacy, Anonymity, Deployments)

1. Service node proof generation for light push clients is deployed on TWN.
2. Service node proof generation for light push clients is enabled by default in nwaku-compose.
