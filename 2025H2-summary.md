# Milestones Presentation (Half-Year to Dec-2025): Waku

TODO what's up with eco dev grwoth

## üß≠ Key Outcome(s) of Vision you are supporting

- Create Chat SDK MVP - one-to-one (Nim, Rust, Golang), support Status' technical roadmap, supports Logos Movement and Logos Core by enabling secure conversations over Waku
- Simplify a reliable Waku API and SDK (Browser, Nim, Rust, Golang), supports Chat SDK, Logos Movement and Logos Core, make it is easy to integrate
- Improve Waku Developer Experience by stabilizing The Waku Network and reviewing Docs: Support Logos Movement, make it is easy to integrate
- Deploy metrics to measure Waku and any Waku app's level of adoption: Support measuring success of Logos Movement
- Introduce mixnet for message sending: Support Logos Vision of a private technology stack
- Formalize and Expand Waku Web Apps: Support Logos Movement on teaching them how to hunt
- Integrate RLN with Waku API: Supports Chat SDK, and Logos Movement to make it easy it to integrate Waku RLN.
- Streamline DevEx: Mobile, and Web dev, supporting Status to have nwaku and chat sdk on mobile, provide tooling to make it easy to integrate js-waku
- Extend Chat SDK with Group conversations: ditto create chat sdk
- Nim Usage Improvement: Dedicate time to improve nim usage (nimble usage, iterate on ffi api, study `nimsuggest` behaviour): to improve nwaku contributor experience, enable all goals above and make it easy to contribute
- Continue Waku Incentivisation: Finish Light push PoC and define next step, to make Waku infrastructure decentralized and sustainable, as per Logos Vision

Strategy changes:

- New Chat protocol over adapting existing code and protocol ([justification](https://forum.vac.dev/t/chatsdk-motivations/501))
- Prioritized simplifying Waku API/SDK, to enable Chat SDK but also "make it easy to integrate"
- Prioritized RLN API/SDK, to use with Chat SDK and have early RLN integration in the Chat stack (this time)
- De-prioritized nwaku on mobile in favour of Waku API and RLN API
- Increased commitment to build applications over Waku (Web and Logos Core), to "teach them how to hunt"
- Introduced Developer Experience items: to support Chat SDK, and "make it easy to integrate"
- Nim Usage Improvement: increased priority to support new chat sdk, and "make it easy to contribute"
- De-scoped any Communities or existing Status chat protocol work, apart from e2e reliability as it is a re-usable block for Chat SDK.
- RLN Mainnet is a long term goal, focus instead of smaller, achievable items that enable integration and dogfooding of RLN.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Keys Risks Identified & Controls

| Risk                                            | (Accept, Own, Mitigation)                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cryptographic primitives in Nim                 | Expect to nim-wrap existing Rust/C libraries - will consult with Vac to lean towards libraries already used in Nim/IFT ecosystem.              |
| Timeline uncertainties for research items       | Focus on iterative delivery of usable deliverables, to get early feedback and direction and lower cost of failure.                             |
| Nim ecosystem and tooling maturity              | New initiative to foster Nim community within IFT, work closely with Vac/Nim re tooling, block time to migrate to Nimble.                      |
| RLN UX                                          | Integrate in web apps, continue dogfooding and iteration, close collaboration with Status.                                                     |
| Readiness of status-go for Chat SDK integration | Weekly sync up on chat sdk and status-go refactoring topics between Waku and Status teams, collaborative planning done to align goals and API. |

## ‚úÖ Key Observations

- Exciting 6 months ahead with clear path on how to deliver value to both Status and the Logos Community with the same effort.
- Improving work tracking with Vac-DST/Vac-QA, discussion is ongoing to better integrate Waku FURPS in Vac planning.
- We know have a breaking change strategy for Status items.
- Aiming more of a team rally behind milestones, dev milestones are now larger and contain more items that can be done in parallel, so that most of the team work on same milestone together.
- Focus on more frequent milestone delivery, by avoiding intra-dependency of items in milestone.
- Increasing collaboration between research and engineering teams, to ensure early unblocking and neat wrap-up of items. 
- The "Waku (Messaging) API" was initially a tidy up task, as Waku was already integrated in Status. With a focus towards Chat SDK and growing a developer community, it became an urgent-important item.
- Intent to continue internal hackathon initiative with 2 more occurrences in 2025 (tentatively July and October).
