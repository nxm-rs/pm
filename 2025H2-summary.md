# Milestones Presentation (Half-Year to Dec-2025): Waku

## üß≠ Key Outcome(s) of Vision you are supporting

- Create Chat SDK MVP - one-to-one (Browser, Nim, Rust, Golang), support Status' technical roadmap, supports Logos Movement and Logos Core by enabling secure conversations over Waku
- Simplify a reliable Waku API and SDK (Browser, Nim, Rust, Golang), supports Chat SDK, Logos Movement and Logos Core, make it is easy to integrate
- Improve Waku Developer Experience by stabilizing The Waku Network and reviewing Docs: Support Logos Movement, make it is easy to integrate
- Deploy metrics to measure Waku and any Waku app's level of adoption: Support measuring success of Logos Movement
- Introduce mixnet for message sending: Support Logos Vision of a private technology stack
- Formalize and Expand Waku Web Apps: Support Logos Movement on teaching them how to hunt
- Integrate RLN with Waku API: Supports Chat SDK, and Logos Movement to make it easy it to integrate Waku RLN.
- Streamline DevEx: Mobile, and Web dev, supporting Status to have nwaku and chat sdk on mobile, provide tooling to make it easy to integrate js-waku
- Extend Chat SDK with Group conversations: ditto create chat sdk
- Nim Usage Improvement: Dedicate time to improve nim usage (nimble usage, iterate on ffi api, study nimsuggest behaviour): to improve nwaku contributor experience, enable all goals above and make it easy to contribute
- Continue Waku Incentivization: Finish Light push PoC and define next step, to make Waku infrastructure decentralized and sustainable, as per Logos Vision

Strategy changes:

- New Chat protocol over adapting existing code and protocol ([justification](https://forum.vac.dev/t/chatsdk-motivations/501))
- Prioritized simplifying Waku API/SDK, to enable Chat SDK but also "make it easy to integrate"
- Prioritized RLN API/SDK, to use with Chat SDK and have early RLN integration in the Chat stack (this time)
- De-prioritized nwaku on mobile in favour of Waku API and RLN API
- Increased commitment to build applications over Waku (Web and Logos Core), to "teach them how to hunt"
- Introduced Developer Experience items: to support Chat SDK, and "make it easy to integrate"
- Nim Usage Improvement: increased priority to support new chat sdk, and "make it easy to contribute"
- De-scoped any Communities or existing Status chat protocol work, apart from e2e reliability as it is a re-usable block for Chat SDK.
- RLN Mainnet is a long term goal, focused instead of smaller, achievable items that enable integration and dogfooding of RLN.

## üß© Strategic Benefits Realisable from coming Half-Year (Top 5)

- Deliver better APIs and SDKs: Broadens utility of Waku protocol, including RLN, enable building desktop, browser and mobile app using a unified, simple, Waku and RLN API.
- Sustainable, scalable, secure and usable Chat protocol: Enables anyone to build private native chat application, and set sustainable foundations for Status application.
- Waku web apps: demonstrate how to build on Waku, and iterate on dev ex and UX of Waku APIs and protocols, including RLN.
- Roadmap to incentivisation: Explore how the Waku network can be sustainably scalable, resilient, private and censorship-resistant.
- Introduce mixnet: Deliver on our promise of network level anonymity, starting with sender anonymity.
- Improve Nim usage: improve the efficiency of Waku nim developers, to better delivery our commitments and "make it easy to contribute".
