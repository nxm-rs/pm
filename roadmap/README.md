# Roadmap

Where we guess what we'll build next quarter. Usually wrong, always optimistic.

## Structure

- `YYYY-Q#.md` - Quarterly plans
- `TEMPLATE.md` - Template for quarterly planning

## Philosophy

1. **Plan in quarters** - Anything longer is fiction
2. **Focus on outcomes** - What problem are we solving?
3. **Leave buffer** - Things will break, bugs will appear
4. **Iterate** - Plans change when reality hits

## Current Focus

See the latest quarterly file for what we're actually working on.

## How to plan

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to `YYYY-Q#.md`
2. Fill in the goals (be realistic)
3. Link to epics and milestones
4. Review monthly and adjust

Remember: The plan is not the goal. Shipping working code is the goal.
