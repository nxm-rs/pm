# Q4 2025 Roadmap

## Theme
Get the basics working reliably before adding fancy features.

## Goals
1. Make nexum stable enough for daily use
2. Get vertex to push and retrieve chunks from Swarm network
3. Establish development and release processes

## Key Deliverables

### nexum
- Basic transaction signing that actually works
- Key management that won't lose your keys
- CLI interface that doesn't require a PhD

### vertex
- Reliable peer discovery and connection
- Push chunks to network (pushsync protocol)
- Retrieve chunks from network (retrieval protocol)
- NO local storage - just relay/proxy functionality

### Infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline that catches bugs before users do
- Automated testing that tests actual functionality
- Documentation that developers can actually follow

## Metrics
- nexum: 100+ test transactions without losing funds
- vertex: Successfully push and retrieve 1000+ chunks
- Both: <10 critical bugs in production

## Dependencies & Risks
- Ethereum RPC endpoints being reliable (they won't be)
- Swarm protocol not changing dramatically (it might)
- Team not getting distracted by shiny new features

## What we're NOT doing
- Mobile apps
- GUI interfaces
- Token launches
- Blockchain revolution
- Local chunk storage in vertex (this quarter)

## Monthly Checkpoints
- **October**: Core functionality working in test environment
- **November**: Beta testing with patient users
- **December**: First stable release (hopefully)
