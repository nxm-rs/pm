# Execution Summary (Half-Year to June-2025): Waku

## üß≠ Key Outcome(s)

- Integrated nwaku in Status Desktop, progress towards decommissioning go-waku and pave the way for nim libraries to be integrated in any native desktop application.   
- Stabilized store performance for Status Communities usage, understood the best usage patterns and design around limitations.
- Delivered an end-to-end reliability protocol adapted to Waku's restriction (RLN), applicable for large group chat (Communities) and extensible to small chats (1:1s); progressed on integration in Status Communities and delivered browser library.
- Understood the limitations of in-app, centralized, telemetry and delivered sustainable local metrics approach to analyse usage behaviour.
- Understood working and limitation of existing Status Private Chat protocol. Line out work to use Waku securely and at scale (RLN) and various security limitations and inadequacies
- Delivered new peer discovery protocol (rendezvous) to enable further scaling of Waku applications in terms of number of nodes and node capabilities.
- Integrated local DoS protection mechanisms to all Waku service node, fleet and Status Desktop apps.
- Waku integration started in at least 2 new projects: [chrom.ar](https://x.com/McGee_noodle/status/1915893489151447269), [Portrait](https://openinternetprotocol.com/networking-layer/waku); commitment from 2 other projects (stealth mode).
- Greatly improved RLN UX with onchain tree reducing resource costs on Waku Nodes, actioning lessons from previous dogfooding in The Waku Network. Deployed on Linea Sepolia.
- Defined and delivered first economic cost for RLN membership acquisition via stable coin deposits; including a web app for membership management to allow further dogfooding https://rln.waku.org/.
- Defined first incentivisation mechanism including payment and local reputation (PoC incomplete as of H1)
- Delivered 11 new Waku PoC Applications, as part of Waku internal hackathon (6) and Dev Rel effort to show how to build over Waku (5). This includes PoC Opchan Forum over Waku (FURPS not complete as of H1).
- Collaborated with Vac-QA to migrate status-lib chat testing to status-backend, and include more mobile environment scenarios to improve QA of Waku and Chat protocols.
- Delivered mixnet PoC (partial functionality) to increase sender anonymity, collaborating closely with Vac to mature nim-libp2p implementation.
- Delivered Waku Rust SDK PoC and handed over to a couple community projects.

## ‚úÖ Key Observations

- "RLN Mainnet" was too premature of a goal, the focus has shifted to focus on the next iteration of dogfooding (to be started soon). Next goals will be pushing on Status L2 Sepolia and continue iterating on UX, to provide accompanying library to Chat SDK.
- We aimed to be flexible with Status' dynamic strategy, by dropping items whose value became unclear, and focusing on modular, long-term, sustainable and re-usable work.
- It was too early to formalize integration with Codex. Nonetheless, Waku apps produced by app/chat team have Codex integration and dogfooding of Waku x Codex will continue.
- We attempted to put in place a process with Vac-QA and Vac-DST respectively "certify" `R`s and `P`s. While good on principle, the tracking processes are not there.
- It was a first round of planning with FURPS. Lessons have been learned and being applied for H2.
- The Waku internal hackathon was a great experiment to identify use-case but also improvements to the Waku dev ex. With a focus on building (developer) tribes, its strategic value has increased.
- Milestones that involved breaking changes were dragged across several Status release; need to review how this is planned to not postponed milestone completion dates by months.
- Some research items took time to wrap-up, sort bindings, etc. Will discuss with the team on how we can be better are getting research PoC ready for dogfooding.
