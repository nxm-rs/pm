## Work Tracking and Project Management Process

See [PROCESS.md](./PROCESS.md)

## Reporting Guidelines

### Requirements

The current reporting requirements are 2 folds:

#### 1. Weekly Reporting

Weekly reporting provides an insight on the progress by milestones.

#### 2. Monthly Reporting

Monthly reporting is now handled by the Logos insight team.

### Reporting

**Monthly**:

Handled by insight team

**Weekly**: Report progress on each **active** _Epic_ or _Task_ per subteam.

Every Friday, all team members must add a comment to the GH **issues** (not pull request) they own and worked on the past week or planned to work on next week.

If work is done on several _Tasks_ related to the same _Epic_, team member is free to do their weekly update in common parent issue.

The comment must have the following MarkDown format:

```md
**Weekly Update**

- _achieved_: what was achieved this week; must remain on one line.
- _next_: what will be worked on next week; must also remain on one line.
- _blocker_: any blocking items. Do not include the line if no blocker. 
```

**Omit the lines which are not relevant.**

On Monday, project lead or responsible person for report can run the [milestone-update](https://github.com/fryorcraken/milestone-update) script to generate a report and post it in the Logos Discord.
