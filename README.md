## Reporting Guidelines

### Requirements

The current reporting requirements are 2 folds:

#### 1. Weekly Reporting

Weekly reporting provides an insight on the progress by milestones.

#### 2. Monthly Reporting

Monthly reporting is now handled by the Logos insight team.

### Reporting

**Monthly**:

Handled by insight team

**Weekly**:

Report progress on each **active** _Epic_ or _Task_ per sub-team.

Every Friday, all team members must add their update in the appropriate discord thread *WITH LINKS* to the GitHub **issues** (not pull requests) they own and worked on over the past week and/or plan to work on next week.

If work is done on several *Tasks* related to the same *Epic*, team members are free to link the common parent *Epic* issue.

Please include an update for the following categories:

- achieved: what was achieved this week.
- next: what will be worked on next.
- blocked: blocking items, not required if no blockers exist.

On Mondays PM compiles the updates following sign-off from sub-team Leads and publishes to https://roadmap.logos.co.
