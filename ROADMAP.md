# Waku Roadmap

This live document acts as a high overview of the work likely to be tackled for Waku.

This is not a commitment or planning document, it is aimed to be used as a discussion starter to prioritized and plan
work.
Actual planning and execution is done through GitHub issues and [milestones](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Amilestone).

Definition and scoping strategies for a milestone are TBD.

## Research Milestones

WIP

## Engineering Milestones

### Node Bandwidth Management Mechanism

Finish https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/66.

### PostgreSQL Maintenance

Work on how to best handle PostgreSQL database growth and pruning is in progress and must completed to enable node operators
to handle database growth in an easy and non-disruptive manner.

### Bindings

Provide functioning bindings over nwaku in the following environments:

- NodeJS
- Rust (swap go-waku with nwaku)
- Golang

### Serve Limited Content Topic (Store)

Enable store service to only serve specific content topics.
Note that decentralized peer discovery for content topics is scheduled at a later stage, meaning that application
developers would likely need to pass or hardcode list of store node or an enrtree in their client.

Risk: Need to cater for scenarios where a node connect to a store that does not support their content topic.
TODO: Should a small change to metadata protocol be planned? Should this be a research item instead?

Ref: https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/64

### User Pays Own RLN Membership

Provide a developer-ready API for a user to generate their own credentials and insert them.

Ref: (A) https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/102

### Project Pays RLN Memberships for Users

Provide a developer-ready API and software to enable developers to fund membership for users.
Some concession regarding the privacy of the developer/project infra may be acceptable (e.g. project hosts a REST API to
exchange private commitment).

Ref: (B) https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/102

### Special User Pays RLN Memberships for Other Users

This is a continuation of [Project Pays RLN Memberships for Users](#project-pays-rln-memberships-for-users).
However, requirements are stricter to preserve the privacy of the special user.

TODO: This could be postponed to a future date, depending on appetite, acceptable properties for Status Communities
usage and properties of [Project Pays RLN Memberships for Users](#project-pays-rln-memberships-for-users) solution.

Ref: (C) https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/102

### RLN Credentials Security and Multiple Devices

Define how users should handle their credentials and provide the tooling for it.
Define whether RLN credentials should be shared between application or devices.
May also scope the work to enable sharing credentials between devices, or done as separate milestone.

Note: Support needed from RLNP2P team.

### Composing Waku Protocols to Improve Reliability

Provide recommendation in a form of a library to compose the Waku protocols to minimize message loss at a protocol level.
This is both for relay and non-relay node.
The aim is to provide opinionated libraries that use Waku in a generalized manner.
The library may not fit all use-case and can always be bypassed or forked.
Finally, the expectation is not 100% reliability but simply increased reliability for common scenarios.
Application level solution for more certitude are covered as part of [Minimum Viable Data Synchronization](#minimum-viable-data-synchronization).

This is part of the general SDK strategy and expected to be implemented in each language:
- JavaScript for Browser using js-waku
- Rust/Golang/JavaScript for Node using nwaku bindings.

### Fault-Tolerant Usage of Web3 Providers

Review the usage of Web3 Providers and provide a fault-tolerant strategy to ensure that The Waku Network cannot be DOS'd by Web3 Provider outage.
Strategies such as the software ability to fallback to alternative providers or usage of Ethereum Light Client and Portal network should be considered.

### Waku Relay and Discv5 in a Hostile, Restricted or Subpar Online Network

Proceed with a multi-client analysis of Waku Relay's performance in a somewhat online hostile or subpar network and the ability for a relay node to remain connected when said network:
- Hackathon with poor internet connectivity
- prevent incoming connections
- Usage of proxy or VPN to access Internet
- Mix of WAN/LAN configuration.
- Usage of IPV6

Note: Bluetooth, network mesh and internet outage are not in the scope of this milestone. 

### TLS-less Browser Connections

Enable node operators to serve js-waku browser clients without acquiring a domain name.

Note: WebRTC Direct and webtransport support needed in nim-libp2p and js-libp2p.

### Relay in The Browser

Understand and progress on the viability of using Waku Relay in the browser.

Note: Support from js-libp2p maintainer needed.

### Waku React Native

Provide a functioning React Native library on both Android and iOS.
Likely using js-waku to enable multi-platform development (browser, iOS, Android).

### JSON RPC Deprecation

Deprecate nwaku and go-waku JSON RPC API and replace its usage with REST API across the repos (tests).

### General Status Support

Prioritize Status requirements, bugs or issues.

### Developer Experience Feedback

Expected to receive and action feedback from the usage of Waku libraries.
Feedback may be consolidated in a milestone.

### Operator Feature Requests

Not a milestone per se.
Review and potentially implement operator request feature requests.
Requests may come from Status Community operators.

### Ad hoc Network Formation

Design and implement a protocol that uses TWN to negotiate the creation of an alternative small network that would enable lower-latency or higher bandwidth transfer.

### Unscheduled

- Serve only Content Topic Specific messages (filter, light push)
- Merge js-waku and NodeJS-nwaku APIs to enable usage of single SDK for JavaScript on all environments.
- Review DB choices for embedded, and datacenter node.

## Chat SDK Milestones

### Static Sharding Integration in Status

Complete static sharding integration in Status app and provide support for any issue encountered.

### Status Community Scaling

See https://github.com/vacp2p/research/issues/177

### Use of nwaku in status-go

Identify, plan and start the execution of replacing go-waku with nwaku in status-go. 
Output for 2024 is a feasibility study is done, action plan is drafted and work has started.

The action plan need to take in account the intent to provide Status chat protocol as libraries decoupled from status-go.
Yet, full dependency on said libraries should not be blocking.

### Chat SDK PoC 1

Provide and consume JS library that enable a project to use Waku for chat purposes over TWN.
Exact scope to be defined later. Likely either existing Status Chat 1:1 protocol or [Ethereum Address to Secure Channel](#ethereum-address-to-secure-channel).

This library usage should be demonstrated in a web app a la wakuplay as part of dogfooding effort.

### Extract 1 Status protocol from status-go

This may or may not be the same item as [Chat SDK PoC 1](#chat-sdk-poc-1) as the consideration to be made are different
(market potential vs engineering feasibility within status-go context).

This needs to be done with [use of nwaku in status-go](#use-of-nwaku-in-status-go) in mind with a bigger picture of status-go
future architecture in mind.

### Minimum Viable Data Synchronization

Provide a Minimum Viable Data Synchronization protocol that developer can use to ensure the delivery of messages in their protocol.
Note the [protocol](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/2/) and a [Golang library](https://github.com/vacp2p/mvds) already exist.
The aim is to review and improve the protocol and library using Status feedback, implement the protocol for the browser and provide documentation.

### Ethereum Address to Secure Channel

Working MVP of https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/70/.

### Unscheduled â€“ 2025 Priority

- Private group chat SDK
- Wakuplay usage to dogfood private group chat
- Support of Waku Objects and make it consumable

## Other SDK Milestones

### External Wallet Authentication and Transaction for Webapp

Enable a web app to use Waku to request wallet signature for authentication and transaction purposes.
