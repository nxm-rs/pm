# Inbound and Outbound Requirements

## Flow

The expected flow (feedback welcome to refine it) is:

1. Project A writes requirements to B (outbound for A, inbound for B) in FURPS+ format.
2. Project B responds to A's requirements with their own FURPS+ commitments and roadmap,
   including an overview of which milestones in B's roadmap cover which requirements of A.

Note:

Requirements are negotiable and are stated explicitly to enable said negotiation.

B may not be able to deliver all requirements within a half-year,
a light justification is needed to explain how do we work towards a requirement.
For example: "Building block x, y, z are necessary, and they are being worked on with milestones 1, 2, 3.

Some requirements may be "rejected" as not considered in scope of B's work, ensuring that further discussion happen
and requirements are adjusted.

Finally, B may challenge some requirements, to ensure their are founded, and have been validated by A, through users and community work.
