# Waku Draft Roadmap

Finalised roadmap and milestones can be found on the [Logos roadmap](https://roadmap.logos.co/waku/).

Period in planning: 2025 H1

- [Hardening and Scaling Foundations for Private Chats](https://roadmap.logos.co/waku/milestones/open/2025-hardening-and-scaling-foundations-for-private-chats): finishing off the work and descoping items that have been identified as unneeded.
- [Nwaku in Status Desktop (Relay only)](https://roadmap.logos.co/waku/milestones/open/2024-nwaku-in-status-desktop): work continues, close to completion. 
- [Nwaku in Status Mobile](https://roadmap.logos.co/waku/milestones/open/2025-nwaku-in-status-mobile): deprioritized in favour of improving API for new Chat SDK
- [e2e reliability protocol](https://roadmap.logos.co/waku/milestones/open/2024-e2e-reliability-protocol): work continues, close to completion.
- [Foundation for Communities Optimization](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/milestone/31): this includes finishing a migration, and move community traffic away from 1:1 chat so we complete the work.
