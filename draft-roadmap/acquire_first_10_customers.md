# Business Dev - Acquire First 10 Customers

**Estimated date of completion**: 2025H2 Period

**Resources Required for 2025H2**:
- 1 Business Development Lead
- 0.5 Solution Engineer
- Comms Hubs Support

Onboard Waku first 10 customers. Customers are projects using Waku for their peer-to-peer communication stack, or conversation/chat.
First 10 customers assume involvement from the engineering team to get things right and help co-design.

Status, Railgun, TheGraph, Portrait and Chrom.ar should count as the first five.

A couple of projects are in stealth mode and can be counted in once they go public.

## Strategic Objective

## Risks

| Risk                     | (Accept, Own, Mitigation)                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No dedicated Dev Rel     | Work closely with Logos Movement to funnel developers to Waku. Apply guerilla tacting to leverage current Waku team members. Use Solution Engineer for conference talk and presence. |
| No dedicated Growth Lead | Rely on Comms Hubs for Social Media presence, event organization, content and other initiatives. Leverage keen Waku team members to roll out dev community growth initiatives.       |
