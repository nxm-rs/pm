## Risks

| Risk                                    | (Accept, Own, Mitigation)                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dependency on mix library               | Strong collaboration, integrate early, get involved behind the API |
| Impact on latency and other UX elements | Run simulations and studies to understand impact                   |

## Deliverables

### [Integrate libp2p mix into lightpush](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku/issues/3280)

**Owner**: core research

**Feature**: [Mix](/FURPS/core/mix.md)

**FURPS**:

- F1. Relay nodes can mount mixnet protocol, acting as sender, intermediary or exit nodes.
- F2. Nodes can connect to other nodes that support mix using static configuration.
- F3. Client nodes can send light push requests over the mixnet before delivery to a service node.
- F4. Client nodes can receive a response to a light push request over the mixnet.

- S1. `wakunode2` for intermediary and exit nodes.
- S2. nwaku CLI for sender nodes.
