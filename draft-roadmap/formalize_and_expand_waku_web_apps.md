# Logos Web Apps

**Estimated date of completion**: 19 Dec 2025

**Resources Required for 2025H2**:
- 1.5 engineers for 6 months

Harden select Waku Web apps by extracting libraries and writing protocol specifications:

- Qaku (Q&A over Waku): harden Waku to MVP level, so it can be used for IFT Town Halls, and Logos physical events.
  - Integrate SDS and write specs. 
- Logos Operators Forum: Build a web forum PoC over Waku to serve as a basis for a decentralized Logos forum (opchan).
  - Added: Extend the Forum PoC to new FURPS, to align with Logos Movement needs.

Explore Codex x Waku integration, in Qaku and one other application.

Develop 10 Waku Web Apps PoC, and push them to the community to "teach them how to hunt" as well as inspire developers
to build over Waku.

## Strategic Objective

Logos Movement Community Enabling

## Risks

| Risk                                               | (Accept, Own, Mitigation)                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logos Core Readiness                               | Get involed early with Logos Core, tinker and provide feedback |
| Experimental application spam protection for Forum | Focus on MVP to get user feedback early                        | 
| Spec writing by non-researchers                    | Push for early specs, to enabling feedback and mentoring       |

## Deliverables

### [Forum PoC](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/292) 

**Owner**: App/Chat Dev

**Feature**: [Waku Forum](/FURPS/application/forum.md)

**FURPS**:
- F1-11
- U1-10
- R1-2

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Specs: link to specs
- [ ] Code: link to GitHub issues/PRs/Epic
- [ ] Dogfood: link to dogfooding session/artefact
- [ ] Docs: links to README.md or docs.waku.org (TBD)

### [Codex for Message Archival PoC](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/293)

**Owner**: App/Chat Dev

**Feature**: [Codex Archiving PoC](/FURPS/application/codex_archiving.md)

**FURPS**:

- F1. Any end user can publish a backup snapshot of the entire SDS log to Codex.
- F2. End user (may be privileged) can publish the corresponding Codex CID with metadata over Waku to a dedicated snapshot content topic.
- F3. Participants can query the Waku snapshot topic for the latest CID.
- F4. Participants can retrieve the archived messages from Codex.
- F5. Participants can perform a store Query for more recent messages following the snapshot timestamp and SDS state.

- U1. Workflow should be conceptually identical, whether the Codex interaction is via a local node or Codex gateway.
- U2. Publishing or retrieving via Codex should be optional.

- S1. Developers can use this protocol in web applications.
