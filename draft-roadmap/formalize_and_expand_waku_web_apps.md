# Formalize and Expand Waku Web Apps

**Estimated date of completion**: 19 Dec 2025

**Resources Required for 2025H2**:
- 1.5 engineers for 6 months

Harden select Waku Web apps by extracting libraries and writing protocol specifications:

- Qaku (Q&A over Waku): harden Waku to MVP level, so it can be used for IFT Town Halls, and Logos physical events.
  - Integrate SDS and write specs. 
- Logos Operators Forum: Build a web forum PoC over Waku to serve as a basis for a decentralized Logos forum (opchan).
  - Extend the Forum PoC to new FURPS, to align with Logos Movement needs.

Explore Codex x Waku integration, in Qaku and one other application.

Develop 10 Waku Web Apps PoC, and push them to the community to "teach them how to hunt" as well as inspire developers
to build over Waku.
